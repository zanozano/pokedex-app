## Description

Welcome to the Pokémon API Game, a project built using Node.js that serves as a Pokédex API. This application allows you to retrieve information about various Pokémon species by interacting with a Pokémon API. It provides a simple and convenient way to access details about different Pokémon. Clash with iconic Pokémon via our API-powered backend for separate responses. Unleash the gaming fun and catch 'em all with ease. Gotta code 'em fast!

## Key Features and Technologies

- **API Integration**: Retrieve information about Pokémon species from a Pokémon API.
- **Filter by Type**: Use the filter to display Pokémon based on their type.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Utilizes Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing UI.
